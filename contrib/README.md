# Contributed files

So far, there are four contributed boards here, all from Dr. Eric Silverman:

* `caeth-poly-y-7sided.*`: A Caeth Poly-Y board in the "standard" 7-sided size.
* `noeth-poly-y-7sided.*`: A Noeth Poly-Y board in the "standard" 7-sided size.
* `noc-poly-y-5sided.*`: A Noc Poly-Y board in the "standard" 5-sided size.
* `noc-poly-y-7sided.*`: A Noc Poly-Y board in the "standard" 7-sided size.

The boards are available in both the source Adobe Illustrator format (with the `.ai` extension) and SVGs rendered from those files (with the `.svgz` extension.)

You can read--but not edit--the Illustator files with any standard PDF program.

Per Dr. Silverman, these are also released into the public domain.
