# Contributed files

So far, there are two contributed files here, both from Dr. Eric Silverman:

* `caeth-poly-y-7sided.ai`: A Caeth Poly-Y board in the "standard" 7-sided size, in Adobe Illustrator format.
* `noc-poly-y-5sided.ai`: A Noc Poly-Y board in the "standard" 5-sided size, in Adobe Illustrator format.

Despite being AI files, you can read these with any standard PDF program if you don't have access to Illustrator.

Per Dr. Silverman, these are also released into the public domain.
