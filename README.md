# caethboards
Caeth (and Noc) boards of various sizes for playing different connection games.

These boards are released into the public domain and are best played with
colored pencils, preferably four in two sets of related shades, one for the
voting edges or points and one for the cells themselves.

Pre-rendered letter-sized versions are in the pdf/ directory.  The Inkscape
source SVGs are in src/.

If you want to use these as a base for further works, you'll want to use the
`-unscaled` versions as your base.  They're still grid-aligned, which makes
editing them much easier than the formatted-for-printing files.  (I'd also
appreciate a heads-up as to what you're using them for, but that's obviously
not required.  Just, y'know, appreciated.  My email address is phil PERIOD
